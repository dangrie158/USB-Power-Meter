Since USB has become more and more a power delivery standard, it would be nice to have a convenient way to measure the power consumption these devices need. Of course there are already power meters out there, but they are just boring or don't have all the features I like.

There are two Versions of the board:
One uses a 7 Segment Display module, the other uses a 0.96” OLED Display. The OLED Version is part of the [Hackaday Square Inch Contest](https://hackaday.io/list/7909-square-inch-project-entrants)
